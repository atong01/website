I am starting a postdoc with [Yoshua Bengio](https://https://yoshuabengio.org) studying deep learning and more specifically the causal discovery of cell dynamics at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) in Montreal. This work is in collaboration with [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://www.is.mpg.de/~bs) and [Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/institute/staff/staff/ma/2494/index.html) through the newly formed Helmholtz International Lab, a German-Canadian collaboration.

I recently completed my PhD in the [computer science department](https://cpsc.yale.edu) at Yale University in 2021 where I was advised by [Smita Krishnaswamy](https://www.krishnaswamylab.org).
My current research interests are in causal machine learning, deep learning, and optimal transport. 
I'm working on applying ideas from causality, optimal transport, graph signal processing, and deep learning towards biological, and particularly single-cell, questions. 

I grew up in Seattle, Washington, USA, and graduated from [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu) in 2017 with a B.S. and M.S. in computer science. Outside of work I love sailing and running.
