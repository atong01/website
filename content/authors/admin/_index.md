Starting July 2025, I will be joining [Duke University](https://duke.edu) as an
assistant professor in the departments of [computer
science](https://cs.duke.edu), [cell biology](https://cellbio.duke.edu), and
[biostatistics and bioinformatics](https://biostat.duke.edu). 

I am currently a postdoc with [Yoshua Bengio](https://https://yoshuabengio.org) working
on efficient machine learning algorithms with applications to cell and
molecular biology at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) in Montreal.

I completed my PhD in the [computer science department](https://cpsc.yale.edu)
at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu) in 2021 where I was advised by
[Smita Krishnaswamy](https://www.krishnaswamylab.org). My dissertation can be
found [here](uploads/Alexander_Tong_Thesis.pdf).  My research interests are in
generative modeling, deep learning, and optimal transport.  I'm working on
applying ideas from generative modeling, causal discovery, optimal transport,
and graph signal processing to understand how cells develop and respond to
changing conditions.  I'm also interested in generative models for protein
design and cofounded [Dreamfold](https://www.dreamfold.ai/) to work on these
problems.

I grew up in Seattle and graduated from [Tufts
University](https://www.tufts.edu) in 2017 with a BS and MS in computer
science. Outside of work, I love sailing and running. I am the 2019 junior
North American champion in the [505 class](https://www.int505.org), and I
recently ran my first 50 mile race the [Vermont 50](https://vermont50.com)!
